## About this blog


Today, artificial intelligence, IoT, block chain and cryptocurrency are on everyone's lip. The exponential increase of data that these technology will induce will increase greatly the risks and impacts of a cyber attack. Individuals will encounter fraudulent practices more and more frequently in the times to come. In this blog I will explore different aspects of information security. We will learn about the mechanics of technology in order to better disrupt it. This is intended for people to get involved in world of the computer security by focusing on pratice.

There is a certain aura of romantism in the figure of the hacker. Often despicted as an adolescent or a yound adult with a weak constitution. He is perceived as a creeper, an anti-social individuals by his peers. He has both impressive technical skills but also deep understanding of human nature. This makes any computer in his possession a deadly weapon. Freedom and privacy issues are particularly valuables to him. His favorite accesory is a *Linux* OS distribution.

This is a shame. A hacker is (usually not) a genius computer whiz. The best kind of them can be, but most of the time they are timid criminals. Timids because they don't have to be physically violents, they don't even need to be near their victims to cause a lot of suffering to them. Hacking is the easy part of information security because it's praticionners don't need to care about the legal of learn about technical aspects of the job. They only need to copy-paste some code on Kali Linux and complain in forums that researchers use Virus Total wich render the payloads they use useless.

There a thing I don't like to see in a computer security blog and it is too many screenshots. I understand that a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes too much noise isn't necessary to grasp a concept.
